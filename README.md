### Chisato's More Redstone

This mod introduces more fun redstone devices from the original redstone system, such as AND gates, OR gates, XOR gates and other logic gates. It is also planned to add more fun redstone systems in the future, such as password gates, remote redstone signals, etc. This mod is still in the testing stage

- AND Gate and OR Gate
