### Chisato's More Redstone

This mod introduces a variety of intriguing redstone devices, some inspired by the original redstone system and others
featuring more imaginative designs. Examples include the music box, remote redstone control systems, holographic
projector, bio-data reader, AND gates, OR gates, XOR gates, and other logic gates. You can even use the music box to
listen to songs from the internet with your friends in-game! We plan to add even more fascinating redstone systems in
the future, such as password gates and screening systems. Currently, this mod is still in the testing phase.

# Hologram Projector and Entity Recorder

The holographic projection terminal currently offers three display modes:

## Model Mode

You can right-click on an entity with the Entity Recorder to capture all its information. Right-clicking the holographic
projection terminal again will then display the holographic image of the recorded entity.
