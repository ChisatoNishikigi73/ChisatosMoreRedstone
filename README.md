### Chisato's More Redstone

This mod introduces more interesting redstone devices, some of which originate from the original redstone system, while
others are more imaginative. For example, the musicbox, remote redstone control systems, AND gates, OR gates, XOR gates,
and other logic gates. You can even use the musicbox to listen to songs from the internet with your friends in the game!
We plan to add more interesting redstone systems in the future, such as password gates, screening systems, etc. This
module is still in the testing phase.

- Music Box

You can use the musicbox to play songs from the internet in the game!

- Wireless Redstone

You can remotely control redstone devices that share the same frequency.
